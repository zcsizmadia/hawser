// Package pipeproxy bridges the Windows named pipe that stock docker.exe
// expects to the engine's Unix socket inside the WSL2 distro.
//
// This is the load-bearing component the project is named for. Spike A (#2)
// proved the design end to end and measured it: the per-connection relay
// process starts in ~6 ms, while the surrounding wsl.exe startup costs ~165 ms
// per connection — the cost the v0.2 vsock agent removes. Correctness matters
// more than either number, because every Docker client behavior rides on it:
// hijacked streams (exec -it, attach), incremental streaming (logs -f), and
// half-closes (build, save) all break in different, confusing ways if the relay
// is sloppy.
//
// The transport deliberately knows nothing about HTTP. Byte-for-byte fidelity
// is what makes hijacked connections work at all; request rewriting (bind path
// translation) is layered on top rather than baked in here.
