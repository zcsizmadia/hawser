== Now do this by hand ==

  1. SIGN OUT completely (Start > user > Sign out).
     Do NOT just lock the screen - locking keeps your session alive and proves
     nothing. RDP disconnect does not count either.
  2. Leave the machine alone for at least 3 minutes.
  3. Sign back in and run:  .\05-verdict.ps1

Optional, and the stronger test for the CI-runner claim:
  1. Reboot instead of signing out.
  2. At the login screen, wait 3 minutes WITHOUT logging in.
  3. Log in and run .\05-verdict.ps1

The service writes a heartbeat every 15s, so the log will show whether the
engine stayed reachable while nobody was present. Recorded start of window:
