Read the log above. The decisive line is 'distro-visible':

  ok=true   LocalSystem sees the distro -> session 0 works, this is the simplest
            viable pattern. Continue to 04 to test the no-login window.
  ok=false  per-user registration is the blocker (expected). The distro must be
            imported as whichever account the service runs under - that is what
            03 tests with a dedicated account.

Next: .\03-service-dedicated-account.ps1
