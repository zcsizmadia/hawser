# Spike B step 3: dedicated service account that provisions its own distro.
#
# The pattern PLAN §09 proposes, and after step 02 the only one left: WSL refuses
# to run as LocalSystem outright (WSL_E_LOCAL_SYSTEM_NOT_SUPPORTED), so a real
# account is the only remaining option.
#
# The service imports the distro itself rather than having something else import
# it beforehand. Two reasons: WSL registration is per-user, so the account that
# runs the service must be the account that owns the distro; and running
# `wsl --import` as another account from outside needs stored-credential rights
# a bare service account does not have (schtasks fails with "A specified logon
# session does not exist"). Self-import is also what `hawser install --headless`
# would have to do in production, so it is the more useful thing to measure.

The decisive lines:

  self-import-result          can a session-0 service account register a distro?
  distro-visible-after-import does it then see it?
  socket-up                   does dockerd start under that account?

All three ok -> the dedicated-account pattern works. Run 04 to test the
no-login window, which is the part that actually matters.

Any of them failing -> session-0 operation is not achievable on this WSL.
That is a NO-GO for PLAN section 06's headline claim, and worth knowing now.

Next: .\04-nologin-window.ps1
