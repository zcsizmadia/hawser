# Assembles the Hawser rootfs.
#
# Built as a container image and then `docker export`ed, rather than unpacked
# and modified on the host. That matters: apk's post-install triggers run
# chrooted, and `apk --root` against a host directory fails them with exit 127
# (ca-certificates hashes, terminfo, iproute2), leaving a rootfs that looks
# populated but is subtly wrong. Building natively runs every trigger the way
# Alpine intends, and sidesteps the root-owned-files problem on the runner.

# Runtime dependencies. None of these are in the Alpine minirootfs, and their
# absence only surfaces when the engine is actually booted:
#   iptables/ip6tables  dockerd cannot build container networking without them
#   iproute2            ip/tc, used for veth and bridge setup
#   ca-certificates     registry TLS
#   socat               the v0.1 pipe relay connects through it
#   e2fsprogs/xfsprogs  filesystem tooling for volumes
#   kmod                modprobe for overlay, br_netfilter, ip_tables
#   util-linux          mount, nsenter, unshare
#   pigz                parallel gunzip; a large, cheap win on image pulls
#   xz                  xz-compressed image layers
#   tini-static         becomes docker-init, which `docker run --init` needs.
#                       moby vendors tini rather than exposing a make target
#                       for it, so it comes from Alpine (also MIT-licensed).
#                       Copied rather than symlinked: an absolute symlink
#                       dangles whenever the rootfs is inspected from outside,
#                       which is exactly what the smoke test does.
