# Boot the rootfs and run a container in it.
#
# This exists because the smoke test was green while shipping a rootfs whose
# engine could not start — twice. Checking that files exist and that
# `dockerd --validate` passes verifies the shape of the artifact, not that it
# works: a valid config plus a missing binary is still a dead engine.
#
# Every one of these was caught by hand, after publishing, and would have been
# caught here:
#   - daemon.json used max-files instead of max-file  -> dockerd refused to start
#   - docker-proxy missing                            -> dockerd refused to start
#   - socat and iptables absent from the rootfs       -> no networking, no relay
#   - docker-init missing                             -> `docker run --init` broken
#
# Runs on any Linux host with Docker (CI uses ubuntu-latest). Needs --privileged
# because dockerd sets up cgroups, iptables and overlayfs.
