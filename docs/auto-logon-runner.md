# Running Hawser unattended (CI runners, build agents)

Hawser's supervisor keeps the engine alive across crashes, `wsl --shutdown`,
and sleep/resume — but it needs a **logged-on interactive session** to do it.
This page documents how to give a headless machine one. It is documentation on
purpose: Hawser will not set up auto-logon for you, because doing so means
writing an account password into the machine's LSA secrets, and a tool that
does that silently on your behalf is a liability a security review would
rightly reject. You set it up, with eyes open, or you do not.

## Why a session is required

WSL2 will not create its utility VM from session 0 (a Windows service). This
is a WSL platform constraint, not a Hawser one — it binds Docker Desktop and
Rancher Desktop identically:

- `LocalSystem` is refused outright (`WSL_E_LOCAL_SYSTEM_NOT_SUPPORTED`).
- A dedicated service account fails inside the Host Compute Service with
  `ERROR_LOGON_TYPE_NOT_GRANTED` even holding Service + Batch + Interactive
  logon rights and local administrator.

So an unattended machine needs a real user session. In practice that means
auto-logon: the machine boots, logs a chosen user in, and Hawser's supervisor
starts with that session (via the per-user autostart entry, below).

> The session-0 findings above are marked provisional in the plan (Spike B,
> issue #3) pending a re-test on a clean VM. Until that lands, treat auto-logon
> as the supported path for unattended machines.

## The playbook

### 1. Create a dedicated local account

Use a purpose-made low-privilege local account for the runner, not a personal
or domain admin account. Auto-logon stores this account's password on the
machine; scope the blast radius accordingly.

```powershell
# Elevated PowerShell
$pw = Read-Host -AsSecureString "Password for the runner account"
New-LocalUser -Name "hawser-runner" -Password $pw -PasswordNeverExpires
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Users" -Member "hawser-runner"
```

Local administrator is **not** required for Hawser itself (install runs
non-admin). Add it only if your CI jobs need it.

### 2. Install Hawser as that user

Log in as `hawser-runner` once, interactively, and install. This registers the
per-user autostart entry so the supervisor starts at every logon:

```powershell
hawser install --headless
hawser autostart status   # should report enabled
```

`hawser autostart` uses the per-user `Run` key and launches the windowless
`hawserw.exe`, which starts `hawser supervise` — an interactive-session
process, which is exactly what WSL2 needs. (A scheduled task set to "run
whether logged on or not" performs a batch logon into session 0, where WSL
cannot start; that is why Hawser uses the Run key, not a task.)

### 3. Enable auto-logon

Use Sysinternals **Autologon** (recommended: it stores the password in an LSA
secret rather than plain text in the registry):

```
autologon.exe hawser-runner <domain-or-machine> <password>
```

The registry alternative (`DefaultUserName` / `DefaultPassword` under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`) stores the
password **in clear text** and should be avoided.

### 4. (Optional) Lock the session after logon

If the machine sits in the open, auto-logon then immediately lock keeps the
desktop from being usable while the session — and therefore the engine — stays
alive. Add a per-user startup entry:

```
%SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation
```

Locking does not stop the supervisor; the session remains logged on.

### 5. Verify

Reboot. With no interactive login, from an SSH session or a remote build step:

```powershell
docker version          # the engine answers
hawser status --json    # "supervisor":"running","engine":"running"
```

## Security notes

- Auto-logon means the machine boots into a usable (or lockable) session with a
  stored credential. Treat the machine as holding that credential: restrict
  physical and RDP access, and prefer a dedicated account with only the rights
  the runner needs.
- Combine with an idle timeout (`hawser config set idle-timeout 30m`) so an
  unattended machine reclaims the engine's RAM between jobs; the next `docker`
  command wakes it.
- Nothing here is Hawser-specific plumbing — it is standard Windows unattended
  configuration. Hawser only asks for the session it documents here; it never
  creates it for you.
